			<h3 class="author">Jared-Fogle updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Removes older ID consoles completely. You will no longer be able to find the circuitboard or research it. Consider creating a computer and installing the Plexagon Crew Management app instead.</li>

				<li class="balance">The wizard's immovable rod from can now impact with any other immovable rod to create a singularity. This probably kills the wizard. This definitely kills the rod.</li>

				<li class="balance">The wizard's immovable rod form is now incorporeal and flying.</li>
